# Advent of Code 2022

My participation for advent of code 2022.

I decided to write this in rust because I do not know this language very well. Hopefully some of the problems this year can help me learn some of the language fundamentals so I can use it to build cool stuff.

These solutions are not even close to being optimal. I try to be conscious of runtime while I am writing these solutions, but this is more for me to get a feel for this language then to write the best possible code.
